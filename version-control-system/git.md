## What is a gitignore file?
A plain text file containing a list of all specified files and folders from project that Git should ignore and not track\
All ignored files get stored in a .gitignore file.\
Each of the files in any current working Git repository is either:
> tracked - files or directories that are newly staged (added with git add) and committed (committed with git commit) to main repo <br>
> untracked - any new files or directories created in the working directory but have not yet been staged (or added using git add command) <br>
> ignored - all files or directories that Git knows to completely exclude, ignore, and not be aware of in the Git repository<br>

## What to include in a .gitignore file?
> Operating system files (macOS, windows, and linux) -- .DS_Store <br>
> Configuration files generated by applications e.g code editors and Integrated Development Environment(IDE), files custom to you, your configurations and preference settings<br>
> Files generated by package managers e.g. npm node_modules folder, used for saving & tracking dependencies for each package you install locally <br>
> Sensitive data & secrets e.g. files with your login credentials, environment files with environment variables containing API keys need to remain secure and private <br>
> Runtime files such as .log files, provide information on operating system's usage activities and errors, as well as history of events that have taken place within OS.
