## What is a gitignore file?
A plain text file containing a list of all specified files and folders from project that Git should ignore and not track\
All ignored files get stored in a .gitignore file.\
Each of the files in any current working Git repository is either:
> tracked - files or directories that are newly staged (added with git add) and committed (committed with git commit) to main repo <br>
> untracked - any new files or directories created in the working directory but have not yet been staged (or added using git add command) <br>
> ignored - all files or directories that Git knows to completely exclude, ignore, and not be aware of in the Git repository<br>
