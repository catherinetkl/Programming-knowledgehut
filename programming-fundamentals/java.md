## Introduction to Java
Java is a typed language. \
There are two distinct type groups:\
1. primitive data types
2. abstract data types
## What is the difference between signed and unsigned variables?
- Signed variables, such as signed integers will allow you to represent numbers both in the positive and negative ranges.
- Unsigned variables, such as unsigned integers, will only allow you to represent numbers in the positive.
- Unsigned and signed variables of the same type (such as int and byte) both have the same range (range of 65,536 and 256 numbers, respectively), but unsigned can represent a larger magnitude number than the corresponding signed variable.
(Adding 128 + 127 = 255)
- To reiterate, the main differences between Signed & Unsigned data type or variable in java is:
  Unsigned can hold larger positive values, but no negative values.
  Signed can hold -128 to 127.
