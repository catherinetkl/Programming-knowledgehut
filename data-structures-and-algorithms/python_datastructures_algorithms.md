# Python

## Time complexity
a function that measures how long an algorithm takes in terms of the quantity of input it receives\
Measured in the number of operations that it takes to complete something

## Space complexity
a function that measures how much memory (space) an algorithm requires to the quantity of input to the method\
if preserving space is the main priority and time taken for the operations to complete is not held with as much importance
