# Agile
## 1.1 Definition
Ability to <b>evolve</b> your products <b>quickly</b> and continuously to fulfill <b>customer needs</b>

A philosophy (4 values & 12 principles) that encourages organization models where people collaborate towards a common goal

Create a collaborative, sustainable, self-managing/self-organizing environment (System) where value emerges through interaction between developers and customers and is released early and often

### Example
Losing weight - We want to do that quickly, but it's not an easy feat\
From business' perspective
- requires for us to be disciplined in the way we work
- engage customers regularly to understand whatever we are building is in the right direction or not
- regularly reflect the way we are building products, processes, how teams interact/collaborate, policies governing us

Akin to a vehicle that brings you from point A to point B
Different types of vehicles
- cars
- boats
- trains

Based on the complexity of work, different ways are needed to achieve Agility
- Scrum
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Kanban

Choose an appropriate agile framework depending on the kind of work that you do

## 1.2 Manifesto For Agile Software Development AKA Agile Manifesto
A written statement towards the beliefs, aims, policies of an organization or a group\
Set of 4 values and 12 principles agreed upon by a group of people

### How did it come to existence?
In early 1990s, there were 20 odd software developers who were unhappy with the way their organization's developed products
- Started using lightweight methods of developing products
    - Extreme programming
    - Scrum
    - Crystal
    - Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM)

Later, they worked for other organizations as consultants and helped them succeed with the new ways of working

In 2001, 17 of them met up at Snowbird resort and spent 2 days to jot down their common beliefs and principles

## 2.1 Agile Value 1 - Individual & Interactions over Processes and Tools
### Why are processes needed?
To streamline the way we interact and work together (be it as a team, customer & service provider or even as a family)

Each time you travelled to a different country, do you do things the same way you do at home?\
NOPE! Learn the mannerisms to ace your interactions with the locals

Processes are very much required for people to interact\
If processes impede that interaction, then we should change the processes to improve the interaction\
Change the processes based on experience and learning, then processes are fulfilling its value

## 2.2 Agile Value 2 - Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
### Example 
Go to fine dining restaurant and order food, waiter writes everything on paper and confirms with you\
Chef comes to you with the list of all the ingredients they are going to use and tells you the proportions to get you onboard on that\
You go through it thoroughly and they give you a thumbs up\
The waiter places on the table the following:
- a comprehensive report of the profile of the chef
- infographics of the process they will follow while cooking
- a list of sauces with the labels that you can choose from along with the main course
 Finally when food arrives, it is not up to your standard
 
 ### Which is better?
 A complete documentation of the food order that the customer placed OR
 you get the customer to taste at different appropriate stages during the process of cooking
 
 The latter adheres to the second value of Agile Manifesto
 
 ### Why do we need documents that we create during product development?
 E.g. Requirements specification, Design Documents, etc.
 - Main purpose:  to establish Shared understanding
 - For future reference (a SIDE-EFFECT)
 - To prove to the customer that this is what they said

Abstract products like software are very difficult to imagine and jot down on a piece of paper<br>
Hence, FOCUS on anything that <b>helps customer see and feel</b>, helps in shared understanding and building useful products

Documents needn't be hundreds of pages, could come in various formats
- prototypes
- wireframes

## 2.3 Agile Value 3 - Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
### Scenario
Customer engages jewellery company to make a customized gift in celebration of his wedding anniversary with his wife, however as the days approaches the client collection date, he notified the customer that something went wrong with the manufacturing at the workshop and they were unable to deliver the correct design of the wedding anniversary gift to the customer 

### What went wrong?
Just following the prescription that the customer wrote with respect to the specifications of the design and then involve the customer at the end during the time of delivery
- The jewellery company employee did not engage the customer frequently

### Correct approach
- Involve the customer frequently (Create a paper sketch of how the jewellery would look like & get feedback on it)
- Create the ring without the diamonds on it and check with the customer for the size before putting the diamonds on
- Confirm the message with the customer before actually engraving the message onto the ring

We need contracts for collaboration, but collaboration should take the precedence (driver's seat) to succeed in business

- You need to build a feedback loop with your customers so that you can constantly ensure that your product works for them
- Focus should be on continuous development

### Essence of this value
Building products to solve users' problems
A product that does not help users get some job done is useless
Collaborating with the customers to understand what adds value to them, helps you to build products that you can actually SELL and maximise your return of investment (ROI)

## 2.4 Agile Value 4 - Responding to Change over following a plangm
Achieving the goal is more important than following a specific plan, but that doesn't mean plan is not required\
We need to continuously evolve our plans to achieve the goal

The trouble with static roadmaps is that we don’t live in a static world<br> 
Needs and requirements are always shifting, and priorities are always changing<br>
That static roadmap will soon grow outdated

That’s why the Agile Manifesto suggests that a software team should have the ability to pivot and change direction whenever they need to, with a flexible roadmap that reflects that<br>

A dynamic roadmap can change from quarter to quarter, sometimes even month to month, and agile teams are able to keep up with those changes

## 3.1 Agile Principle 1 - Making early value delivery as a top priority for the product development teams by delivering increments of the product continuously
Organizations make products to make business out of it<br>
To maximise ROI, need to make more sales<br>
When do people buy our products?
- Product solves a problem for the user
- Helps them get the job done better than the alternatives they use today

### Example: Patient Management System for a hospital
1. Deliver working software that captures the patients information
2. While you continue to work on developing other features like capturing the diagnostic reports, doctor's notes, etc (Work in progress - WIP)

## 3.2 Agile Principle 2 - Welcome changing requirements, even if they are late in development. Agile Processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
Referring back to Patient management system, doctors when they see their own notes/memo, they have the issue of not having enough time to key in the notes
Given that they only spend 15-20 minutes per patient, the request for voice notes to Alexa and prescriptions cannot.

#### What should be done?
1. Don't accomodate these changes as they are coming too late into the game OR
2. Prioritize these features and accomodate that as the features for the upcoming product sprint\
   Unless these features are added, otherwise the product wouldn't be useful to the doctor at all
   
When the products fall in complex contests, you may not be very clear of the customer's needs and the needs emerge each time you deliver a piece of work<br>
Using iterative delivery to competitve advantage by building the product that's current with the market needs

## 3.3 Agile Principle 3 - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
Going in alignment with principle 1, delivering value for the customer, better for both customer and business
In complex product context, you need continuous and frequent feedback from the customers to reduce cost of delay
In case of products like software, customer is unable to give you the feedback unless and until they see and experience and feel the products,
hence it makes sense to build the products incrementally and in shorter cycles

## 3.4 Agile Principle 4 - Business people and Developers must work together daily throughout the project
Let's say you have a group of business people who talk with the end-users and gather requirements. They then document it and send it to the development team
Developers develop the product based on what they understand from the documents
Do you think this is effective? Why is it not effective?
- Possibility that requirements could be misunderstood
- With each hand-off, there could be potential loss of information<br>
In essence, there must be <b>DAILY INTERACTION</b> between the developers and business people to ensure the right practice is effectively built to solve the end-users problems

## 3.5 Agile Principle 5 - Build products/projects around motivated individuals(teams), give them the environment (create a system) and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
When you pay enough to people not to think of money, what motivates them are <b>3 things</b>
1. Autonomy (the desire to be self-directed)
2. Mastery (the desire to excel at their craft)
3. Purpose (the desire to relate to something)

## 3.6 Agile Principle 6 - The most efficient and effective method of conveying(exchanging) information to and within a development team is through face-to-face conversations
We all come from different <b>cultural & linguistics backgrounds</b> 
These could potentially be barriers for communication
When it comes to building complex products like software, the information that is exchanged is complex too
That doesn't mean sitting together in one place, but if you are sitting in the same building, same floor, but exchanging information using email or phone, THAT IS INEFFICIENT
Irrespective of whereever that you're sitting at, make it a habit to exchange the information face-to-face
It could either be being physically present (<b>FACE-TO-FACE</b>) OR over a digital medium like Skype or Zoom, to be both effective and efficient
