# Agile
## 1.1 Definition
Ability to <b>evolve</b> your products <b>quickly</b> and continuously to fulfill <b>customer needs</b>

A philosophy (4 values & 12 principles) that encourages organization models where people collaborate towards a common goal

Create a collaborative, sustainable, self-managing/self-organizing environment (System) where value emerges through interaction between developers and customers and is released early and often

### Example
Losing weight - We want to do that quickly, but it's not an easy feat\
From business' perspective
- requires for us to be disciplined in the way we work
- engage customers regularly to understand whatever we are building is in the right direction or not
- regularly reflect the way we are building products, processes, how teams interact/collaborate, policies governing us

Akin to a vehicle that brings you from point A to point B
Different types of vehicles
- cars
- boats
- trains

Based on the complexity of work, different ways are needed to achieve Agility
- Scrum
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Kanban

Choose an appropriate agile framework depending on the kind of work that you do

## 1.2 Manifesto For Agile Software Development AKA Agile Manifesto
A written statement towards the beliefs, aims, policies of an organization or a group\
Set of 4 values and 12 principles agreed upon by a group of people

### How did it come to existence?
In early 1990s, there were 20 odd software developers who were unhappy with the way their organization's developed products
- Started using lightweight methods of developing products
    - Extreme programming
    - Scrum
    - Crystal
    - Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM)

Later, they worked for other organizations as consultants and helped them succeed with the new ways of working

In 2001, 17 of them met up at Snowbird resort and spent 2 days to jot down their common beliefs and principles

## 2.1 Agile Value 1 - Individual & Interactions over Processes and Tools
### Why are processes needed?
To streamline the way we interact and work together (be it as a team, customer & service provider or even as a family)

Each time you travelled to a different country, do you do things the same way you do at home?\
NOPE! Learn the mannerisms to ace your interactions with the locals

Processes are very much required for people to interact\
If processes impede that interaction, then we should change the processes to improve the interaction\
Change the processes based on experience and learning, then processes are fulfilling its value

## 2.1 Agile Value 2 - Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
### Example 
Go to fine dining restaurant and order food, waiter writes everything on paper and confirms with you\
Chef comes to you with the list of all the ingredients they are going to use and tells you the proportions to get you onboard on that\
You go through it thoroughly and they give you a thumbs up\
The waiter places on the table the following:
- a comprehensive report of the profile of the chef
- infographics of the process they will follow while cooking
- a list of sauces with the labels that you can choose from along with the main course
 Finally when food arrives, it is not up to your standard
 
 ### Which is better?
 A complete documentation of the food order that the customer placed OR
 you get the customer to taste at different appropriate stages during the process of cooking
 
 The latter adheres to the second value of Agile Manifesto
 
 ### Why do we need documents that we create during product development?
 E.g. Requirements specification, Design Documents, etc.
 - Main purpose:  to establish Shared understanding
 - For future reference (a SIDE-EFFECT)
 - To prove to the customer that this is what they said

Abstract products like software are very difficult to imagine and jot down on a piece of paper<br>
Hence, FOCUS on anything that <b>helps customer see and feel</b>, helps in shared understanding and building useful products

Documents needn't be hundreds of pages, could come in various formats
- prototypes
- wireframes
