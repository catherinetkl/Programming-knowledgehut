## 1.2 Manifesto For Agile Software Development AKA Agile Manifesto
A written statement towards the beliefs, aims, policies of an organization or a group\
Set of 4 values and 12 principles agreed upon by a group of people

### How did it come to existence?
In early 1990s, there were 20 odd software developers who were unhappy with the way their organization's developed products
- Started using lightweight methods of developing products
    - Extreme programming
    - Scrum
    - Crystal
    - Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM)

Later, they worked for other organizations as consultants and helped them succeed with the new ways of working

In 2001, 17 of them met up at Snowbird resort and spent 2 days to jot down their common beliefs and principles

## 2.1 Agile Values 1: Individual & Interactions over Processes and Tools
### Why are processes needed?
To streamline the way we interact and work together (be it as a team, customer & service provider or even as a family)

Each time you travelled to a different country, do you do things the same way you do at home?\
NOPE! Learn the mannerisms to ace your interactions with the locals

Processes are very much required for people to interact\
If processes impede that interaction, then we should change the processes to improve the interaction\
Change the processes based on experience and learning, then processes are fulfilling its value
