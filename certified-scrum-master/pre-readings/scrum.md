# Scrum
## Definitions
An empirical process framework for building complex products
Scrum is a framework, which can be used by product development teams to self-organize to solve complex and adaptice problems
Basically, to build complex products

## Difference between a framework and a method?
Someone handing over an under-construction house to you, with foundations and pillars built, but nothing else
Although you had something to start with, but you can't begin living in this building without walls, rooms etc.
You have been given some guidelines to follow while building the house based on your location.
You have the choice of creating beautiful rooms and fantastic living space. How beautiful the house turns out to be depends on your taste and the decisions you make
That's framework for you

Another approach would be to build a house with everything and you can just move in
You have the freedom of where you place your furniture, decors, etc
But you can't change the shape and size of your rooms 
That's method for you

Framework is like React JS and method is like an application like LinkedIn
