# Why do we need Scrum and ScrumMaster?
What is product?
- meet the customers needs, users needs
- could be a software or hardware (tangible and intangible)
- services, streaming platform
- problem-solution fit
- Workshop also addresses problem-solution fit

How do you see yourself in 5 years time?
What is the vision?
1. define the purpose
2. why are we doing what we are doing
3. what is the tangible outcome?

what is the product goal?
- gain knowledge required to get started as a scrummaster


Why do we need scrum?
Acceptance criteria
Prod

cost of delay opportunity cost 500k opportunity cost 300k that can be reinvested into something that brings a certain ROI

Documents can be interpreted in different ways
Assumptions could be related to functionalities

How doe we validate the risk? not risk mitigation plan go to customer and get the risk certified continuous and frequent feedback
 what are the processes and policies used today?

Proof of concepts - validate assumptions
wireframing and prototyping, mockups
When you show something, you get better feedback it can help us to validate functional but not technical assumptions  proof of concept is better than mockups
Limitations -   incremental delivery - usable condition
Sprints enable us to do incremental delivery (time box)  exams 100 questions,  why do we need scrum? Enable us to do incremental delivery
Value for business - return of investment 2 types revenue and profit

Product discovery
Market research, user research
Limitations   scrum — don’t work intermittently, work in fixed periods of time invested interest in the product, stakeholders in which specific event - sprint review - demonstrate the product to the stakeholders feedback in the review whole team will come together during product   why do we need scrum?
When work is complex, there are unknowns, we make asumptions, we incur costs we aim to minimise cost, incremental delivery in the event of sprints, and sprint review
Sprint planning, sprint development,  each sprint last 4 weeks country is a product, government is a system sanitizer is a product, healthcare is a system school is a product  multiple teams work on a single product 1 product - 1 product owner 1 scrum team - 1 scrum master
Product owner - focuses on maximising rot
Scrum master - focuses on systems, making it efficient  do I feel the need to get things done - developer
When people approach you with the problem, move away from the problem, don’t react in situations when you need to be - scrum master  understanding the what will enable you to figure out of how to get the work done  4 types of product contexts  Obvious, simple or clear - if and only if, problem and solutions have been identified, not making assumptions internet access - service provider - interactive voice responsive system - problem gets resolved on the call 
Have a ready made solution to it
Can make SOPs, no need special skills for it, multiple internet service providers
Industry standards best practices  different categories to it, predefined checklist sense, categorise, respond


Complicated:
Problem identified, no solution readily available (unknown) when wifi is not working, call service provider (10% cannot be resolved), filing incident to engineer
They make sense of the problem, need to analyse problem to see which preexisting solution fits better, respond with an appropriate solutions,
Making assumptions - subject matter experts   chaotic: (safety)
Problem is not unknown but unpredictable and unknownable, no solution identified
Flash floods, earthquakes, war, pandemic man-made or natural disasters consequences are way more disastrous
Time extremely sensitive, system is out of control 1. Act - conscious intentional action, understanding the consequences
2. Sense
3. Respond
4. Novel practices

Complex: (experimentation)
Understand the problem better
Creating a vaccine for covid-19
Run short experiments to understand why things are happening
1. Probe
2. Sense {Analyse/categorise }
3. Respond

Mass production of cars - obvious
Customising a model of car - complicated (subject matter experts)
Recall of a car - chaotic (child lock system malfunction - result of a problem, life will be at stake)
Designing an autonomous car - complex (desirability of the product is unknown, feasibility is unknown, do short experiments)  complex domain of experimentation

Agile is a philosophy - stays on top of everything, multiple ways to reach agile, encourages organisations where people collaborate to work towards a common goal

Empiricism - learn, adapt and improve
Goal is a destination( certain profit targets)
Different vehicles to reach the destination

Extreme programming - iterations
Scrum - sprints
Prescriptions
How do I know scrum is applicable for me or not

Each problem has a set of knowledge base already
Application support L1
For an obvious and simple problem, you don’t need scrum
It’s an overkill. Can go with lean or DIY

Complicated: 
We know the problem, but not the solution
Application support L3
Collect logs and debug
Problem-solution fit
scrum+ Kanban = scrum-ban

Complex:
Keep building without feedback - increased delayed cost
Iterative and continuous delivery
We need scrum for solving complex problems
Scrum of scrums (large scale scrum) — complex
Any new product development or built

Chaotic:
Disaster recovery to bring up the system

As a coach, don’t be on the side of resistance
Start working by creating safe environments

How do mental models changes?

We are seeking more awareness

Believing that change is possible

Do you think liminal thinking is easy to develop?
Not easy, it requires you to be intentional

Eric smidth - feedback is 

What we know, we think is the right way, thus we need coaches, to have differing perspectives and awareness and make 

What is lean thinking?

Value stream
Eliminate waste
Value-added activities
Security — take out electronics and placed on a tray
Can you go on a leave without taking leave of absence?
Non-value adding activities

Increase value-added activities and reduce non-value adding activities
Understanding goal very well is crucial
VP is looking for specific outcomes
How that ladder of house works
What is the low hanging fruit?
Scrum artefacts create transparency which allows to do inspection — events (use an opportunity to inspect sprint goal and sprint plan)

PO - Business
Developers - Solutions
Scrum master - systems

If don’t understand why, it will be an unassignable problem 
Prevent events from turning into attitudes and behavioural patterns
Sprint backlog refinement
10 minutes plan
20 minutes development
10 minutes
